# What is cross compilation?
Cross-compilation is the process of compiling code on one computer system (called the host) to create executable code that runs on a different system (called the target).
This process is useful in embedded systems as the target device has limited resources and cannot host a compiler or development environment, such as microcontrollers or IoT devices

# How can we cross compile Qt for RaspberryPi? 
We need to use Qtrpi!
ToDo: Check ressources how to use Qtrpi for cross-compiling!
